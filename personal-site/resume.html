        <p>First I blow him, then I poke him. Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to. There are dozens of us! Dozens! She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. God knows they're squinters. Heyyyy uncle father Oscar.</p>

        <p>So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! Monday morning. COME ON! Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball and remain motionless when confronted.
