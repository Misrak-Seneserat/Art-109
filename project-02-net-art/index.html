                    <p>
                        The Five Nation was founded by a man named Allah (honorably Clarence Edward Smith) in the
                        early 1960s in Harlem, New York. Allah, a former member of the Nation of Islam. He left to
                        teach the youth the "Knowledge of Self," focusing on self-empowerment, community engagement,
                        and the understanding that every Black man can become his own God. Sharing a deeper
                        understanding of divinity beyond traditional religious structures. In late 1963, Clarence,
                        now
                        known as "Allah", along with his companions Abu Shahid (formerly John 37X), Free Cipher
                        Akbar
                        aka Ol Man Justice C (formerly James Howell), and Hebeka (formerly Eugene 32X), began
                        walking
                        the streets of Harlem, teaching the youth about their divine nature and their potential. By
                        October 1964, Allah officially established the Five Percent Nation. The Five Nation derives
                        its
                        name from the concept that only Five of people possess true
                        knowledge and understanding of themselves and the world, while the remaining 95% are either
                        ignorant or oppressors.

                        The cards below contain the Supreme Mathamatics 1-9. The purpose of these "poor righteous
                        teachers" is to educate and enlighten members about spiritual truth. Supreme Mathamatics is
                        a
                        philosophical code representing universal truths and principles. By understanding the
                        natural
                        order of the universe through numbers you develop knowledge of self and mental clarity.
                        Allowing members make
                        logical connections in life, developing a sense of "living mathematics."
