    <h1>The Future of the Internet</h1>
    <p> I myself am a conspiracy theorist, and I find the internet genuinely terrifying. People often talk about the future of the internet as if it were like the movie The Matrix. This is a theory I agree with, though highly unlikely, because we are already living in a matrix. We must start with the meaning of the word matrix, as it will help us better understand the matrix of the internet. The word matrix comes from the Latin word “mater,” which is defined as “breeding female or womb.” Today, if you look up the word matrix in the Oxford dictionary, it is defined as “an environment or material in which something develops; a surrounding medium or structure.” From my understanding of science, sacred geometry, religion, and philosophy, this Earth was not a big bang accident. Whether or not you believe in religion, there is evidence of a “great creator.” This Earth is so meticulously thought out beyond human comprehension that our government continues to fund environmental research through federal agencies. The Earth we currently inhabit is a matrix, and the human body is also a matrix. These are both examples of self-contained environments where life can develop. Similar to the internet, our universe, and the human body are systems of information powered by energy. The difference between the two is the type of energy they use. The internet is powered by electrical energy, which is the flow of electrons in a current typically at a high voltage. Whereas all living things use bioelectricity, which is the movement of ions across a cell membrane, creating electrical potentials, thus causing cell signaling. This bioelectric cell signaling is essential to development and rejuvenation. The common misconception is that your DNA holds all the code for genetic development, but there are actually no clear instructions for the shape, size, or symmetry of the body. Genomes actually encode a system of plasticity that allows for flexibility and changes to occur in response to stimulation. Due to the fact that scientists and researchers are still trying to decipher the code of the human body, I don't see the movie The Matrix being our future anytime soon. They use two very different electrical systems, and even if scientists decode the human body, they would still have created their own “biological code” for the internet to sustain life. In the next 100 years, I see humans using the internet and technology to play god. I believe that the internet is just another tool of mass manipulation, much like the media. Though the recent advancements in AI technology have led me to believe that the future is being able to transfer your consciousness into an internet avatar. In the same way the internet is stealing your information, I think the AI will start stealing or collecting people's souls. The reason I believe this is the future is because scientists have been conducting brain-computer interface experiments across the globe for years. It's not a coincidence that Neurolink is being promoted so heavily currently. I also don’t think AI being free and open to the public is just a coincidence either. AI is only free because it’s still in its developmental stage, and the only way to make a computer more human is to have it interact with humans. I think in the beginning, there will be an exclusive secret internet society for only rich elites. In attempts to harbor the wealth, ceo’s, politicians, and rich elitists will be paying to have their consciousness transferred into an internet avatar so that they can be immortal and rich forever. Once they acquire their avatar, the next phase would be taking over the World Wide Web. These politicians and ceo’s will be able to control the internet, making it the main tool of mass manipulation. This would take us into full-on censorship, and social media brands, news, games, and even content creators would be wiped off the internet. The general public will no longer post content to the internet because it’s now being run by a secret society of internet avatars. Soon, the public will be required to undergo brain-computer interface surgery similar to NeuroLink. But instead of being able to control a computer, the computer would be the one controlling you. Now, at your job, the boss and CEO of the company you work for is an immortal internet avatar with the ability to control your mind. I think the new reality will look like digitalized capitalistic slavery, where our oppressors paid their way to play god. </p>
